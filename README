To compile this branch you need the linaro toolchain. 

To do this simply run the included script in the root of this repo by running ./fetch-linaro-toolchain.sh

Once that is complete simply run ./compile-with-linaro.sh

If you want to compile this branch in-line with ROM compiles one more changes is needed, pull the kerenl.mk_ from prebuilt-scripts and place it in ~/android/system/build/core/tasks/ and renmae to kernel.mk
